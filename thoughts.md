## Two Takeaways from Mod0 as it relates to success at Turing.
1. Developing a mindset to code is just as important as the coding itself. For instance, learning to google correctly or knowing how to approach a problem via 'pseudocode' is tantamount in importance to solving the problem itself.
2. Time management is absolutely critical to getting things done in a timely manner. Calendars, especially ones that have reminders and are color coded, are excellent for this!

1. Researching and growing on my own (note the markdown learning that just happened).
2. Reading notes before lessons, and reviewing them the next day.
