<h1> Two Takeaways from Mod0 as it relates to success at Turing.
1. Developing a mindset to code is just as important as the coding itself. For instance, learning to google correctly or knowing how to approach a problem via 'pseudocode' is tantamount in importance to solving the problem itself.
2. Time management is absolutely critical to getting things done in a timely manner. Calendars, especially ones that have reminders and are color coded, are excellent for this!
